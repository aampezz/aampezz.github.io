        <p>Just a city girl, born and raised in south Detroit. Well, metro Detroit really. I’m a designer (BFA in Graphic Design) and ed tech enthusiast (MA in Digital Media and Education) who spent 5 years at a small design agency switching hats almost daily between print/web design, marketing and brand strategy, copywriting, project management, information architecture, and business development.</p>

        <p>I’m passionate about education technology, reform, and access, as well as arts education and after-school programming. I’ve taught art classes with the USO in Germany and fully believe there are no greater life-long investments than travel and education.</p>

        <p>I’m currently work as UI/UX designer for Zydeco, an iOS app supporting middle-school science inquiry learning. Ultimately, I hope to design more beautifully usable products that help people learn and explore.</p>
